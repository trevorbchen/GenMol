## 🔬 GenMol V1
### Training
We provide the pretrained [checkpoint](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/clara/resources/genmol_v1). Place `model.ckpt` in the checkpoints directory and set the correct information in ./configs/base.yaml.

(Optional) To train GenMol from scratch, run the following command:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node ${num_gpu} scripts/train.py hydra.run.dir=${save_dir} wandb.name=${exp_name}
```
Other hyperparameters can be adjusted in `configs/base.yaml`.<br>
The training used 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and took ~5 hours.

We suggest the use of [SAFE dataset V2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/datamol-io/safe-drugs) to train GenMol (Note V2 removes some invalid molecules/corrupted SAFE strings. The original data that was used by GenMol is available here [SAFE dataset V1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/datamol-io/safe-gpt/tree/b83175cd7394).

### (Optional) Training with User-defined Dataset
To use your own training dataset, first convert your SMILES dataset into SAFE by running the following command:
```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py ${input_path} ${data_path}
```
`${input_path}` is the path to the dataset file with a SMILES in each row. For example,
```
CCS(=O)(=O)N1CC(CC#N)(n2cc(-c3ncnc4[nH]ccc34)cn2)C1
NS(=O)(=O)c1cc2c(cc1Cl)NC(C1CC3C=CC1C3)NS2(=O)=O
...
```
`${data_path}` is the path of the processed dataset.

Then, set `data` in `base.yaml` to `${data_path}`.

### *De Novo* Generation
Run the following command to perform *de novo* generation:
```bash
python scripts/exps/denovo/run.py
```

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting: _pickle.UnpicklingError: invalid load key, '<'</summary>

If you see this error, it is likely coming from `/miniconda3/envs/genmol/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tdc/chem_utils/oracle/oracle.py`, line 347, in readFragmentScores `_fscores = pickle.load(f)`

The root cause is a corrupted or incompletely downloaded pkl file for the SA score. The fix is simple: grab the correct files from the official RDKit repository:
https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/tree/master/Contrib/SA_Score/fpscores.pkl.gz

Extract the downloaded file into the `genmol/oracle` directory.

The experiment in the paper used 1 NVIDIA A100 GPU.

### Fragment-constrained Generation
Run the following command to perform fragment-constrained generation:
```bash
python scripts/exps/frag/run.py
```

The experiment in the paper used 1 NVIDIA A100 GPU.

### Goal-directed Hit Generation (PMO Benchmark)

We provide the fragment vocabularies in the folder `scripts/exps/pmo/vocab`.

(Optional) Place [zinc250k.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basu369victor/zinc250k) in the `data` folder, then run the following command to construct the fragment vocabularies and label the molecules with property labels:
```bash
python scripts/exps/pmo/get_vocab.py
```

Run the following command to perform goal-directed hit generation:
```bash
python scripts/exps/pmo/run.py -o ${oracle_name}
```
The generated molecules will be saved in `scripts/exps/pmo/main/genmol/results`.

Run the following command to evaluate the result:
```bash
python scripts/exps/pmo/eval.py ${file_name}
# e.g., python scripts/exps/pmo/eval.py scripts/exps/pmo/main/genmol/results/albuterol_similarity_0.csv
```

The experiment in the paper used 1 NVIDIA A100 GPU and took ~2-4 hours for each task.

### Goal-directed Lead Optimization
Run the following command to perform goal-directed lead optimization:
```bash
python scripts/exps/lead/run.py -o ${oracle_name} -i ${start_mol_idx} -d ${sim_threshold}
```
The generated molecules will be saved in `scripts/exps/lead/results`.

Run the following command to evaluate the result:
```bash
python scripts/exps/lead/eval.py ${file_name}
# e.g., python scripts/exps/lead/eval.py scripts/exps/lead/results/parp1_id0_thr0.4_0.csv
```

The experiment in the paper used 1 NVIDIA A100 GPU and took ~10 min for each task.

## 🚀 GenMol V2: GenMol with Extended SAFE Syntax (Angle-Brackets for Inter-Fragment Attachment Points)
### Summary: 
GenMol V2 introduces Extended SAFE Syntax, which uses *angle-brackets* for Inter-Fragment Attachment Points. This change improves performance for specific tasks, particularly one-step linker design.

### Introduction:
Following SAFE-GPT, GenMol performs two-step linker design in fragment-constrained generation, i.e., two molecules are respectively generated given each of two fragments and then combined later as a single molecule. However, users may prefer one-step generation that can condition the context of both fragments at the same time.

While GenMol shows versatile performance on various tasks, it shows low validity in some tasks, especially in one-step linker design. We attribute this to the standard SAFE syntax, which considers the `intra-fragment` (linked atoms are in the same fragment) and `inter-fragment` (links between two fragments) attachment points are not easy to distinguish. 

To this end, we propose an extended SAFE syntax that uses angle-brackets to distinguish intra-fragment attachment points from inter-fragment attachment points.

For example, a SAFE string
```
X1XXX1X2.X2X3XXXX3X4.X5XX5X4
```
has 1, 3, 5 as its intra-fragment attachment points, while 2 and 4 are inter-fragment attachment points. With the extended syntax it becomes:
```
X1XXX1X<1>.X<1>X1XXXX1X<2>.X1XX1X<2>
```
In this way, the links within a fragment (i.e., 1, 2, ...) are independent to links crossing fragments (i.e., <1>, <2>, ...) and the model can learn how to complete a SAFE more efficiently.

GenMol V2 trained with the extended SAFE syntax actually shows significantly improved performance on *de novo* and fragment-constrained generation! On goal-directed hit generation and lead optimization, GenMol V2 performs slightly worse than GenMol. This is because GenMol performs fragment remasking in these tasks, which changes only a small part of the entire molecular sequence, and therefore does not benefit from the extended SAFE syntax.
