# Model Overview

## Description:

GenMol is a masked diffusion model<sup>1</sup> trained on molecular Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding ([SAFE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10773)) representations<sup>2</sup> for fragment-based molecule generation, which can serve as a generalist model for various drug discovery tasks, including De Novo generation​, linker design​, motif extension​, scaffold decoration/morphing​, hit generation​, and lead optimization.

This model is ready for commercial use.

## License/Terms of Use:

Governing Terms: Use of this model is governed by the [NVIDIA Open Model License](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/enterprise-software/nvidia-open-model-license/). GenMol source code is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). By using GenMol, you accept the terms and conditions of this license.

Deployment Geography: Global

Use Case: GenMol is a flexible generative AI tool for small molecule design in drug discovery. Its primary use cases include:
Generating novel molecules: GenMol can create new, valid molecules from scratch (de novo design).
Optimizing existing molecules: It can be used to modify and improve current molecules through inference tasks like scaffold decoration, motif extension, superstructure generation, and linker design.
Property optimization: When paired with external scoring models or methods, GenMol aids in designing molecules with specific desired properties, which is a critical step in developing effective drugs.
